I decided to look into medium format rangefinder cameras and discovered that they all use leaf shutter systems which are in the lens. The camera that really intrigued me was the Mamiya Press which is pretty much a black box with a bunch of attachments. -----> I !!!  honestly think -----> -----> I !!!  can create !!!  a medium format camera to base off a certain lens system. I just don’t know which lenses I should base it off. Anyways if someone can point me into a set of lenses with a 1/500th shutter speed and possibly smaller lenses that would be great. I just don’t really know much about medium format.",
