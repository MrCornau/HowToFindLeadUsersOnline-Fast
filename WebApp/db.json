I noticed that the camera is next to useless in situations where there is a strong light source in the frame, so it would be really handy if the focus lock also locked the exposure.",

I rented a Canon Mark IV yesterday to take photos at an award show and used two different SD cards because I was scared of them maybe making me erase data (they didn't everyone just got yelled at). So I was on my way to transfer the files to my computer and then return the camera when I got a call from the company so I just decided to go there and transfer and then just turn it in quickly. The first SD card I made a copy of the file and moved it to my desktop and the second I only needed half of the photos so I created a new file, moved the photos there and then moved the file to my computer. I passed out and did not check the files till today in the afternoon. All the photos from the first file transferred over but the second filed I cannot find at all. I texted the camera shop and they said the SD was rented out again and they had already released the data and would not know when it would be back. I have been desperately trying to find a recovery system to help but I am not sure what to do because I have searched all places on my computer. The only trace of it I could find is when I was trying to save a photo in photoshop and one of the places that came up was the name of the file but with the white page icon and when you click on it, photoshop just chooses another file to save it to instead. Attached is what it is. I use a Macbook Pro with OS 10.13.6 running. If any has advice please let me know, I had some amazing photos on there and I really don't know what to do. I would go back to the shop in person but it seems hopeless especially with what they already told me and not having good communication skills at the ready.\n\n![img](wlrnzciwbcu11)",

      "selftext": "I had been using my Fuji XF 18-55 lens with my X-T1 to scan photos, as I detailed in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/9c4sun/my_method_of_digitizing_negatives_with_a_camera/). However, as I am knee-deep in the Minolta analog system, I decided to get a macro lens that I could use both with a mount adapter and directly on my Minolta bodies. I got a Rokkor MC 50mm f/3.5 macro lens from KEH (condition ugly, but the glass looks fine!) for about $25. Here are the results of this lens versus the Fuji lens with a 16mm extension tube.\n\n*Processing img a48riwhh5ap11...*\n\nThe outlined X is the size of a 35mm frame (36x24mm). Notice the clear barrel distortion and the softening in the corners. I could correct the distortion easily enough in Lightroom, but I couldn't do anything about the softness. \n\nHere's the same shot with the Minolta macro lens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fc5lbzet5ap11...*\n\nThis is right out of the camera, with no editing. Immediately it is clear that there are sharp corners, and no distortion at all. Now, I lose the ability to use autofocus when I scan, but as I'm set up on a tripod it stays consistent throughout, and it's easy enough to adjust for each frame if I need to. However, now I'm extremely confident that I'm getting the entire frame sharp. I should also note that this lens did not come with the 1:1 extension, but the lens does 1:2 natively. As the Fuji is APS-C, this means the 35mm frame can still fill a fair amount of the sensor. If I had a full frame camera I would probably want the extension, but as of right now this is a huge improvement for a small expense. I was quite surprised by the quality of the macro lens so I wanted to share. ",

      "selftext": "Been posting a lot on the Discord channel but thought I'd bring the conversation here as well. I've spent the last few weeks building both a hand rotary and now have a working prototype for a motorized one. You can see the prototype moto-rotary [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DELlfA0ovs). The hand roller is mostly the same - just two sides without the motor mount.\n\nIt works with my development controller I've been working on (while also working on my Film Log webapp) also but the moto-rotary could be used on its own with a direct 12V source, a simple timer/h-bridge circuit, etc. It's not much more than 3D printed parts I designed plus things common to 3D printing (608 bearings, all-thread rods, etc.). It's not the most optimized but for a version 1 I feel it's usable at least for my needs if nothing else.\n\nMy idea is to try and build DIY/kit components so folks can use part or the whole thing. Already have a Sous Vide? Then you don't need to worry about temperature controlling the water bath and can let the controller manage the rotary and optionally be your development timer. Don't want a rotary, you can use the water bath features. Want to control multiple water baths? You could do that too.\n\nMuch like Prusa did with 3D printers, the idea was to make part (or all) of it open source/open hardware.\n\nI favor an iterative design over a JOBO-clone because Imean honestly a JOBO is going to be awesome, especially with a lift. This is for folks that want something cheaper (but less good haha) and configurable. It seems like trying to make an easy to build kit for what a JOBO is, at least right now, I think is out of reach. So instead of trying to do that all at once, I think there might be value in doing it in pieces.\n\nThoughts?",

The app should work with any Canon Cameras which support BR-E1 remote. The official list is 77D, 800D, 200D and 6D Mark II. I am only able to test the app with my 200D as I have only one camera.

This app allows the phone to be used as Canon's BR-E1 bluetooth remote. The app should work with any Canon Cameras which support BR-E1 remote. The official list is 77D, 800D, 200D and 6D Mark II. I am only able to test the app with my 200D as I have only one camera. I would like to know if this app works with any other canon cameras.

      "selftext": "We have all seen how good recent sensors are, capable of capturing almost 15 stops of dynamic range, or having incredible low light performance, and often both. We see video cameras and hybrids that are implementing dual native iso. There is incredible advancement in the field for making amazing sensors. \n\nBut, as the title asks, why aren’t there more cameras that are implementing dual native iso, or maybe even a camera with triple native iso? Especially for smaller sensors, who’s low light performance tends to suffer more than larger sensors, this seems like it would be a great opportunity to get the most out of a particular technology. Of course, anything that can be used to improve smaller sensors can be used to improve larger sensors, but the point is simply why don’t more cameras do this, especially smaller sensor cameras that would probably greatly benefit from that loins of architecture. \n\nFor examine, I own a panasonic GX85. It’s a great camera with about 12-13 stops of dynamic range, and it maintains 10 stops of dynamic range down to about 800 iso (according to DXOmark). even then, I can get relatively clean pictures down to about 1600, and 3200 iso is still the lowest usable iso for acceptable pictures before the image really starts to break down. Why not have another native iso at 1600, which would allow probably allow the camera to achieve rather impressive low light performance for its sensor size? A micro four thirds camera would be a great candidate for this use case in photography, but, the only micro four thirds camera I know of that uses dual native iso is the GH5 (and GH5s?), and I think it only uses dual iso in video mode.\n\nAdditionally, why do we have to stop there? Why not make sensors with 3 native ISOs? One can be at 100, or even 50, for daylight situations, a other native iso right where the sensor stops being able to capture at least 10 stops of dynamic range (using my panasonic, right around 800), then another native iso for low light situations, say around 3200, or even 6400. I understand this would be a more expensive sensor to implement, but, for example, smaller sensor cameras tend to cost less, so the savings there could be used to optimize the sensor further, making crop sensor cameras a more viable alternative to their larger cousins. \n\n___\n\nRelated to this: why couldn’t we have a camera that captures images with 2 different ISOs at the same time? This idea might only be feasible on larger megapixel cameras, or larger sensor sizes. I also understand this idea would be more technologically complex than the idea above, but bear with my explanation. \n\nThe Sony A9 is capable of global sensor readout to enable silent electronic shutter shooting with no trolling shutter artifacts (i’m sure there are other cameras, this is just the one that immediately comes to my mind). Understanding that an increase in ISO requires a reduction in shutter speed, and knowing that the sony A9 is capable of global shutter readout, why couldn’t we have a sensor where half the pixels are at a low iso (such as 100), and the other half are at at an iso a few stops higher than this (say 400, or 800). When an image is recorded, the global electronic shutter closes on the higher iso pixels 2 or 3 stops earlier than the shutter closing in the sensor altogether.\n\nWhy would anyone do this? It could allow increased dynamic range in a single exposure. Let’s take my GX85 again and say it only has 12 stops of dynamic range. If we made a GX85+, we could potentially increase the dynamic range of the sensor by the however many stops of separation those two ISOs are at (so, from 12 to 14 or 15), and this is without counting whatever other gains we could get in noise reduction due to technically combining 2 separate exposures into an image. \n\nIf we apply this to a FF camera with 14 or 15 stops of dynamic range and a high megapixel count (to offset the fact that half the pixels would be captured at one iso, and half at the other, potentially reducing spacial resolution), we could increase the dynamic range to potentially 16-18 stops *just from the two exposures alone*.\n\n___\n\nSorry for the long post, I just hope I was able to explain my questions well enough so anybody can participate. \n\nTL;DR\n\n1) why don’t more cameras employ a dual, or even triple, native iso architecture? It seems like a great way to optimize or offset the limited performance of smaller sensors, especially.\n\n2) why couldn’t we design a sensor a sensor with split ISO, half the pixels capturing an image at low iso, the other half capturing an image at a higher iso, so we can increase the dynamic range of a single exposure by essentially using the sensor to bracket an image in 1 clean exposure, instead of 3 separate exposures?",

      "MarkedSent": "Why don’t more cameras have dual native iso? Also, why couldn’t we have a sensor that captures images using multiple ISOs at once? /!/ We have all seen how good recent sensors are, capable of capturing almost 15 stops of dynamic range, or having incredible low light performance, and often both. We see video cameras and hybrids that are implementing dual native iso. There is incredible advancement in the field for making amazing sensors. \n\nBut, as the title asks, why aren’t there more cameras that are implementing dual native iso, or maybe even a camera with triple native iso? Especially for smaller sensors, who’s low light performance tends to suffer more than larger sensors, this seems like it would be a great opportunity to get the most out of a particular technology. Of course, anything that can be used to improve smaller sensors can be used to improve larger sensors, but the point is simply why don’t more cameras do this, especially smaller sensor cameras that would probably greatly benefit from that loins of architecture. \n\nFor examine, I own a panasonic GX85. It’s a great camera with about 12-13 stops of dynamic range, and it maintains 10 stops of dynamic range down to about 800 iso (according to DXOmark). even then, I can get relatively clean pictures down to about 1600, and 3200 iso is still the lowest usable iso for acceptable pictures before the image really starts to break down. Why not have another native iso at 1600, which would allow probably allow the camera to achieve rather impressive low light performance for its sensor size?

The app should work with any Canon Cameras which support BR-E1 remote. The official list is 77D, 800D, 200D and 6D Mark II. I am only able to test the app with my 200D as I have only one camera. I would like to know if this app works with any other canon cameras.

I got my first mirrorless camera (Sony a6000) about 8 months ago and have purchased a few lenses including a couple lenses that are great for portraits. I try to shoot as often as possible and really, really enjoy it. I enjoy shooting landscapes and astro but also bring my camera to just about every social gathering I go to so I can get some practice with live subjects. I feel i have improved quite a bit within the past few months and am looking forward to developing my skills even more. I signed up for a live, 10-week photography class which starts after the holidays and will cover basics, give assignments which the instructors will critique, and cover post-processing in both lightroom and photoshop, as well as printing and framing. At some point, I would love to be able to turn this into a side hustle, and offer services such as senior portraits, engagement photos, family photos, etc. However, I feel uncomfortable setting prices at this point as I am very much still learning. I was thinking about offering some sort of donation based service to begin with... maybe put up an ad on craigslist, explaining my situation and goals. People they could donate how ever much they feel the service is worth. I would maybe set a suggested donation of 30-40$ for an anticipated 10-20 finished photos. I realize that may be a bit risky as perhaps there will be some people who dont feel my photos are worth any money, but I am mostly interested the opportunities to practice, especially with people I dont know so that I can become more comfortable.

I ended up walking by a \"Little Free Library\" - not sure if these are \"a thing\" in other parts of the world, but my town is heavily populated with these little things that look like a small cupboard on a pole, usually filled with random books or items for passers-by to take and enjoy. It was pretty dark so I used my phone flashlight to peek inside but didn't see anything that appealed to me. However, I did notice a cardboard box on the ground next to the Little Free Library, so I peeked in the box too. The box was mostly filled with kids books written in Chinese (I think - again, it was super dark), and just as I was about to give up, I spotted something unexpected: a camera lens. I dug a little deeper, and [here's what I ended up finding at the bottom of the box](https://imgur.com/a/P6jO5Ir): a Nikon F-301 SLR camera with a Nikkor 35-105mm zoom lens, a Sunpak flash unit, a small flipbook filled with colored lenses that slot into the flash unit, and a Sigma lens which looks to my untrained eye like it's intended for a newer Canon camera. Crazy! I grabbed it all up and hurried home, probably looking suspicious as hell LOL, but it was worth it.\n\nAs you can see in the album linked above, the camera itself is in surprisingly good condition given its age (the date-stamp sticker indicates it was made in 1985) - other than a bit of easily-cleaned corrosion in the battery compartment, it looks clean. I've never used a film camera as an adult (my mom *loved* her Kodak Disc Camera when I was a kid) and so I'm hopeful that it's functional - it would be so cool to try apply some of the skills I've been developing with my Sony Alpha a6400 over the past year to this camera, if it works!\n\nHappy for any tips, suggestions, guidance, etc. - I'm completely out of my depth here but excited to play and learn!\n\n**TL;DR:** Took a walk, found a cool old camera in a box of random free children's books, now excited to get it working and shoot some pics like it's 1985 again!",

      "selftext": "Hello! I just started taking a B&amp;W film photography class, my aunt had an old Canon T70 and I like how it feels a lot. Our first project is landscapes. We are using Kodak TMax 400 (so I've been using ISO 400), shutter speed is set at 60 and I've been using a grey card to meter. The T70 has the split image rangefinder and microprism.

've been creating !!!  our videos in a studio like environment and sometimes do street interviews. We're also planning to make vlogs in the near future. \n\nWe use cheap softboxes, greenbox, lavelier mic etc. We've got a Nikon P510 in hand right now and our old friend has been holding on very well. Our Nikon can only shoot 1080p so it started to limit our editing potential. Cause we do lots of close ups, exponential scaling etc. We are planning to get a 4K camera. After we shoot the video in 4k we're going to fit our captured MarkedSent into a 1080p Premiere Pro sequence so we can edit our video loseless. (At least thats our plan.)\n\nFor vlogs we dont think 4k is important. \n\nIn these circumstances what should we get for 600$? A lot of people recomended Canon M50 for similar use cases on Reddit or on other forums. But please also keep in mind that we do not have the technical background or finantial condition to use or buy more lenses or other stuff after spending 600$ Thank you.",

I haven't had any problems with it until now.\n\nThe first thing that happened was in november 2020 where I used it as a secondary camera on a photo shoot outside. After the shoot when I rewinded the film I noticed that the rewind was super short. And when I developed it the film was completely blank. This had never happened to me and I got super concerned that there is something wrong with the camera, but I did some tests afterwards and everything seemed fine.
