I try to shoot as often as possible and really, really enjoy it. I enjoy shooting landscapes and astro but also bring my camera to just about every social gathering I go to so I can get some practice with live subjects. I feel i have improved quite a bit within the past few months and am looking forward to developing my skills even more. I signed up for a live, 10-week photography class which starts after the holidays and will cover basics, give assignments which the instructors will critique, and cover post-processing in both lightroom and photoshop, as well as printing and framing. At some point, I would love to be able to turn this into a side hustle, and offer services such as senior portraits, engagement photos, family photos, etc. However, I feel uncomfortable setting prices at this point as I am very much still learning. I was thinking about offering some sort of donation based service to begin with... maybe put up an ad on craigslist, explaining my situation and goals. People they could donate how ever much they feel the service is worth. I would maybe set a suggested donation of 30-40$ for an anticipated 10-20 finished photos. I realize that may be a bit risky as perhaps there will be some people who dont feel my photos are worth any money, but I am mostly interested the opportunities to practice, especially with people I dont know so that I can become more comfortable.

I ended up walking by a \"Little Free Library\" - not sure if these are \"a thing\" in other parts of the world, but my town is heavily populated with these little things that look like a small cupboard on a pole, usually filled with random books or items for passers-by to take and enjoy. It was pretty dark so I used my phone flashlight to peek inside but didn't see anything that appealed to me. However, I did notice a cardboard box on the ground next to the Little Free Library, so I peeked in the box too. The box was mostly filled with kids books written in Chinese (I think - again, it was super dark), and just as I was about to give up, I spotted something unexpected: a camera lens. I dug a little deeper, and [here's what I ended up finding at the bottom of the box](https://imgur.com/a/P6jO5Ir): a Nikon F-301 SLR camera with a Nikkor 35-105mm zoom lens, a Sunpak flash unit, a small flipbook filled with colored lenses that slot into the flash unit, and a Sigma lens which looks to my untrained eye like it's intended for a newer Canon camera. Crazy! I grabbed it all up and hurried home, probably looking suspicious as hell LOL, but it was worth it.\n\nAs you can see in the album linked above, the camera itself is in surprisingly good condition given its age (the date-stamp sticker indicates it was made in 1985) - other than a bit of easily-cleaned corrosion in the battery compartment, it looks clean. I've never used a film camera as an adult (my mom *loved* her Kodak Disc Camera when I was a kid) and so I'm hopeful that it's functional - it would be so cool to try apply some of the skills I've been developing with my Sony Alpha a6400 over the past year to this camera, if it works!\n\nHappy for any tips, suggestions, guidance, etc. - I'm completely out of my depth here but excited to play and learn!\n\n**TL;DR:** Took a walk, found a cool old camera in a box of random free children's books, now excited to get it working and shoot some pics like it's 1985 again!",

We are using Kodak TMax 400 (so I've been using ISO 400), shutter speed is set at 60 and I've been using a grey card to meter. The T70 has the split image rangefinder and microprism. I make sure everything is lined up and it looks clear but all the pictures turned out soft/blurry. Is it me or the camera? Should I try a different camera. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks!\n\nEdit: another question I had was what makes cameras like the Canon AE-1 and Pentax K1000 the favorites of Analog photographers? Is it better than something like the Canon T70 or is it just preference?

      "content": "Picture I took with Canon T70 are too soft or blurry. /!/ Hello! I just started taking a B&amp;W film photography class, my aunt had an old Canon T70 and I like how it feels a lot. Our first project is landscapes. We are using Kodak TMax 400 (so I've been using ISO 400), shutter speed is set at 60 and I've been using a grey card to meter. The T70 has the split image rangefinder and microprism. I make sure everything is lined up and it looks clear but all the pictures turned out soft/blurry. Is it me or the camera? Should I try a different camera. If anyone could help I'd really appreciate it, thanks!\n\nEdit: another question I had was what makes cameras like the Canon AE-1 and Pentax K1000 the favorites of Analog photographers? Is it better than something like the Canon T70 or is it just preference? What would the difference between the Canon AE-1 and T70?\n\nAlso here is my picture -----> -----> I !!!  developed !!! . \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/IZI8B",

For most of that time, I was never super into photography honestly; I used it mostly just to take pictures of the wife and dogs and travel shots. Nothing too serious and never much editing. The only lenses I've got are the EFS 18-55/3.5-56 IS, the EFS 18-200/3.5-5.6 IS, and the 50mm 1.8.\n\n \n\nWell recently I've developed a photography itch that needs scratching, thanks in large part to a couple of friends of mine who are serious hobbyists. I want to get more serious, and after a ton of research and reading articles and watching videos and talking with my photographer friends I think it's time to take the plunge into the world of full-frame mirrorless. I'm looking for some input from people who know better than I do about this stuff and maybe who have found themselves in a similar situation in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kind of shooting I plan on doing is mostly photography; videography and YouTube content creation or whatever just isn't what I'm going for. I want to do street photography (especially night-time stuff), travel photography to include landscape stuff, and portrait photography. I'm a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps, and it would be nice to get some great shots of the aircraft in action as well as the Marines hard at work maintaining them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter an obscene amount of research, I thought I had narrowed it down to the Sony A6500.  But then I started reading all about the XT-3, and maybe it would be a better fit for me.  In fact, the only real drawback that I can tell is the lack of IBIS and the effect that may have on low-light stills.  Then again, how important is that really considering the newer backlit sensor and its (likely) better low-light performance than the A6500's older sensor?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for lenses, I was thinking of perhaps foregoing the kit lens altogether and just getting a few good fast primes: the 23mm F/2 for street stuff and general walkaround (I think I really prefer wider angles) and the 35mm F/1.4 for portraiture and sweet, sweet BOKEHHHHHHH!!  Though a 50mm may be more appropriate for portraiture, the Fuji doesn't have anything faster than a 50 F/2 unless you want to pay nearly a grand for a 56 F/1.2!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, what do you folks think?
